# NPC Multifunction Quest Script
# Zone: examplezone
#
# This script implements an NPC that:
#   - Responds to "Hail" with clickable bracketed text for further interaction.
#   - Allows players to purchase a single level for 10,000 platinum.
#   - Offers alternate advancement/leadership experience if level >= 52 for a lower platinum cost.
#   - Summons an item for players who first turn in a Diamond and then request an item.
#   - Can cast beneficial buff spells upon request.
#   - Can port players to a guild lobby (or another designated zone).
#   - Additionally, tells a fun joke when asked.
#
# IMPORTANT: The NPC returns all items given that it does not need.
